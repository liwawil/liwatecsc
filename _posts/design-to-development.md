My career in the technology industry began with a deep passion for game development and game design. Early on, I spent countless hours learning how to code with Python and Blender. I created a series of Blender simulations that inspired me to create more experiences that were just as immersive. Games fit this category perfectly. I developed the skills necessary to simulate liquids, soft bodies, particles, and more. As I learned more so did my desire to understand the full process of turning models and designs into functional games and software. My passion grew to encompass UI/UX design in which I developed and designed an iOS application using Sketch and Xcode. The result is what you see here: LiwaTec Software Company.

## The Roots of Design: Where It All Began

When designing, my primary focus is on making websites, applications, and games that are visually engaging and easy to navigate. Tools like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/free-trial-download.html) became second nature to me as I have the knowledge and skill to create wireframes, prototypes, and user flows. The visual and creative side of design is what I mastered early on in my journey, and this allows me to work on some great projects.

I can control how things look and how things work. My skills do not end with design. They begin with design. To make my designs function, I utilize a variety of frameworks, libraries, and APIs; and many are free on GitHub thanks to the awesome community of developers. My transition from design to development is seamless—I want to be involved in the entire process, from the initial design concept to the final product deployment.

Taking the leap from design to development is what I love to do. Both are immensely rewarding and have lovely careers. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the first step in website development. I realized early on that my experience with design thinking was a major advantage, especially in front-end development, where I could directly influence how users interact with a website.

The most difficult part of this is embracing the complexities of coding. It is no longer about aesthetic choices that you make but about understanding the logic and technical frameworks that make a website fully function. Learning to code is crucial to understanding how to turn designs into products. There are no technical constraints when you have both design and development knowledge.

## Key Lessons Learned From Designing and Developing

Here are the top four lessons that helped me grow as a developer and designer:

1. Mastering the Learning Curve 
   Every new skill comes with a learning curve, and coding was no exception. Learning JavaScript frameworks like React.js and Node.js felt overwhelming at first, but consistency and patience were key. Each new project became an opportunity to grow and refine my skills.

2. Utilizing Powerful Tools Like Vercel 
   When it came time to deploy my projects, I needed a platform that could handle both scalability and speed. I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com), a tool that handles the entire process with templates and fast deployment solutions. It integrates smoothly into my workflow and has significantly improves my ability to launch projects faster. One day I will go pro!

3. Adopting Agile Methodologies
   One major shift was moving from a linear approach to an Agile workflow. Breaking projects into smaller, manageable sprints made development more efficient. Agile methodologies emphasize adaptability and feedback, which are crucial when both design and development are constantly evolving.

4. Design Thinking Found in Development
   My background in design thinking proved to be invaluable during development. As a developer-turned-company-owner, I was able to apply user-centric approaches to problem-solving in the development process. It ensured that the final product did not just look good but worked seamlessly for end users.

### For the Beginners:

Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as these are the building blocks of web development. You don’t need to learn everything at once—start with the basics and build up your skills from there. I began with design as I did not know how to code. No code solutions are awesome and they can speed up your entire process. 

Remember to learn continuously. Technology changes daily and nightly. Stay updated with new tools and frameworks by using platforms like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), or [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Collaborate with Developers on GitHub. You can also read the code for free. One hour of reading code daily will change your life. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and work alongside the developers in your community who are known to be eager to help. The collaboration, study, and research will enhance your understanding of how design translates to code, and it will make you a better developer overall.
