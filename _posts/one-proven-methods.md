Today is about fast-paced delivery and high-quality applications. It is now important, more than ever, to deliver as quickly as possible without error. I will show you how you can streamlines your development process and drastically improve your ability to meet deadlines and far exceed your productivity goals with Git and Vercel. We delve into five proven approaches to ensure that the quality of your work remains high, while speeding up the process of development. Let us begin!

## Use Git with Workflows

Version control systems are the backbone of the process. Developers leverage the potential within to save years of time. With Git workflows, you can avoid common pitfalls and run code that is far more stable. Using a basic **VSC** may be helpful, but advanced techniques like **branching**, **rebasing**, and merge conflict resolution are what we are looking at today.

### Choose Advanced Git Workflows:

Instead of working directly on the main branch, you can use **feature branching** for each new feature. This creates isolation for your work, preventing issues from changing the entire repository. Feature branches allow you to easily rollback if something goes wrong. 

**Rebasing** is an advanced Git feature where you integrate changes from one branch to another without creating merge commits. This will keep your commit history clean and easy to use. Git has a [guide on rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing).

By mastering these two advanced Git features, you can now track changes effectively, make changes with conflicts, and recover from mistakes more easily. This is the ultimate way to keep your project moving faster and smoothly, even when working with large code bases and teams.

## Leverage Front-End Frameworks

Building web applications from scratch will be time-consuming. Today are so many front-end frameworks that it does not make sense to work from scratch unless you are developing your own advanced features. With the current front-end frameworks and hosting platforms you can design and create a website within minutes. They are designed to reduce the amount of repetitive work that comes with web development and optimize your overall workflow. To be specific, **Vercel**, **Next.js**, and **React** are seamless when it comes to integration. You can save hours by automating deployment, rendering, and generation. Let us see how.

### How Vercel Boosts Your Development Speed:

Personally, I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to take care of the hosting and deployment for my web applications. The platform is fantastic for frameworks, it simplifies key processes such as serverless deployment and CDN distribution. This means your applications load faster and handle more traffic efficiently on Vercel than on other platforms.

Vercel offers a wide variety of pre-built templates that you can use as the foundation for your project. There are blogs, eCommerce sites, and landing pages to pick from. They are optimized for performance and security, which is what were are looking for today.

Frameworks like **Next.js** allow you to implement **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to improve the time it takes to load a page, even content-heavy pages. Vercel offers these solutions seamlessly, allowing you to deploy quickly.

With Vercel's **continuous integration (CI)** and **continuous delivery (CD)** pipelines you can automate deployments as soon as you push your changes to your repository. No need for manual intervention, which ensures that your system is always up-to-date.

Leveraging the power of Vercel will give you faster applications with less manual setup. There is less hindrance to your performance.

## Adopt Agile Methodologies for Continuous Integration and Delivery.

By integrating **CI** and **CD** into your workflow, you can shorten development cycles and adapt quickly to feedback or changes in requirements. In the software development industry, flexibility and speed are key. By adopting **Agile** methodologies like **Scrum**, you speed up everything you do beyond just code.

### Advanced Agile Practices in Action:

Agile is a proven strategy for iterating quickly and delivering working software guaranteed.

A typical scrum sprint, when combined with CI/CD pieplines, means that every change you make is thoroughly tested and deployed to staging immediately when you push. You see the impact of the work you do in real-time, fix bugs early, and ensure production is stable.

Tools like **Jenkins**, **CircleCI** or **GitHub Actions** can automate testing and deployment. This catches bugs early and frees your time. With more time you can focus on building new feature, or learning. Learn how to implement CI/CD pipelines with Amazon's awesome guide: [Continuous Delivery](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/).

These Agile methodologies give you a streamlined way to project management and deployment. This ensures rapid progress and faster launches, which is exactly what we are looking for today.

## Conclusion

Increasing the speed of your development process is about working smart with the tools, methodologies, and resources. By adopting Git workflows, leveraging frameworks, and deploying rapidly using platforms like Vercel, you can deliver projects faster without removing any quality.

To further streamline your workflow, Vercel can be used for all your deployment needs. Vercel has powerful integration, extensive templates, and a library of tools that  will help you accelerate your entire development process from beginning to end.
